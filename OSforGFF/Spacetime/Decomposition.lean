# Spacetime Decomposition

This file provides the measure-preserving decomposition of SpaceTime into
time and spatial components: SpaceTime ≃ᵐ ℝ × SpatialCoords.

## Main Definitions

* `piLpMeasurableEquiv` - MeasurableEquiv between PiLp and underlying pi type
* `spacetimeDecomp` - The measurable equivalence SpaceTime ≃ᵐ ℝ × SpatialCoords

## Main Results

* `spacetimeDecomp_measurePreserving` - The decomposition preserves Lebesgue measure
* `spacetimeDecomp_apply` - Explicit formula: spacetimeDecomp k = (k 0, spatialPart k)
* `spacetime_norm_sq_decompose` - Norm decomposition: ‖k‖² = k₀² + ‖k_sp‖²

/-! ### Integral Decomposition for SpaceTime

We establish that integrals over SpaceTime can be decomposed into
iterated integrals over ℝ (time component) and SpatialCoords (spatial components).
This uses `MeasurableEquiv.piFinSuccAbove` and `measurePreserving_piFinSuccAbove`.
